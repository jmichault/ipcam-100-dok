 _Jekyll-plurlingva_ is a skeleton for the creation of multilingual static websites, based on jekyll.
Its purpose is to keep it light and simple.

Its most striking features:

 * design on two columns:
   * left drop-down menu, with: the choice of language, Google search on the site and the menu of the site.
   * on the right the main content.
 * adapted to websites _Github Pages_ .
 * all possibilities of jekyll.
 * can be used to create a blog.
 * Scripts allow you to automatically translate the pages to all languages of the site.
 * the translations are managed by po files:
   * if you edit or add a paragraph on a page, only that paragraph needs to be retranslated.
   * you can send this file to a human translator for correction.
 * Automatically translated texts are indicated by a section that offers the document in the human-corrected languages.
 * The translations use Esperanto as a pivotal language. This choice may seem strange at first glance, but it has several advantages:
   * it is a language with a simple grammar and no exceptions, so it is easier to manage for software translators. .
   * it is a very precise language, generating less ambiguity than English.
   * it is very easy to learn, whatever the language of the learner.
